Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.# What do I need?
I need to generate certificates in bulk

# What is the base or starting point

Needs to use a template

# How will the template generate?

User will provide the template, but in image format, my system needs to make this dynamic; I don’t know how

# What is next?

User may save this for future use in my system. If they need a new template will again provide a new image of the certificate (you may suggest a better file format, which can be used)

# For bulk generation, what is the data

User will provide data in CSV or Excel format, my system will process this data, and using the template,e will make certificates for the bulk users
For now strict in one input and output as the input data can be parse from any format and could make the certificate in any format as png or pdf
For now use csv and pdf
